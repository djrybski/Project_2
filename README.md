Self Critique: 

It was great working with Geldi & Andy on this project because they have more experience than I do and that pushed me to not be the liability in the project. The biggest problem I faced was trying to perfect the layout that the group had agreed upon. The initial CSS I added was not the design expected by my team members and that is 100% my fault. I should have asked more questions about the specifics instead of going in some what sure. In the end it all worked out because of how great my team members were with asnwering any questions i had. Communication is something I need work with when it comes to technical stuff like this and that is why I think this project was so important for me. I feel very confident in my HTML, CSS, and Javascript where I can paint a picture of what I need to do as soon as the task is given to me where before I would have had to look it up online. Im starting to really get a hold of it and I think I can design some pretty cool websites going forward. This was a great semester of learning.
